# Analog IC Designs

ELC2060S23P_9210899:

  . PDK of a UMC 0.13µm technology: MOSFETs Characteristics N_12_HSL130E
  
  . Current Mirror Using gm/ID Methodology
  
  . Power Amplifier Using Tuning Methodology

Analog Function Generator:

  simulate a simple function generator using the astable multi-vibrator to generate 
  the square wave. The function generator should be able to generate square, triangular, 
  and sine waveforms with a frequency range from 10kHz to 1MHz.
